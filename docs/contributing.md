## üìù A Few Style Tips

To keep everything looking consistent, here are a few friendly guidelines:

*   **`shellcheck`:** It's a good idea to run `shellcheck` on your scripts to catch common errors.
    ```bash
    shellcheck your_script.sh
    ```
*   **Indentation:** I use 4 spaces for indentation.
*   **Variable Names:** `snake_case` for local variables and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for global ones.
*   **Function Names:** `lowercase_with_underscores` for function names.
*   **Comments:** If you write something complex, a quick comment explaining it is always helpful.
*   **Keep it Simple:** Try to keep functions and scripts focused on doing one thing well.
*   **Readability:** Clear and simple code is always better than a clever one-liner that's hard to understand.

## üêõ Found a Bug?

If you find a bug, please open an issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/afif25fradana/Felis-Shell-Modular-Dotfile/issues). In your issue, try to include:

*   A clear title.
