Felis Shell comes with a bunch of handy functions to make your life easier. This guide gives you a quick rundown of what they are and how to use them.

## üéØ How to Use 'Em

All these functions are ready to go as soon as you open your terminal. Just type the command and hit enter.

For a quick list of all the shortcuts and commands, just type `shortcut`. If you need more details on a specific topic, use the `help` command (like `help git` or `help dev`).

    ```bash
    mkdir my-advanced-python-app && cd my-advanced-python-app
    pyinitplus
    ```

#### `nodeinit [project_name]`

    ```

#### `webinit [project_name]`
