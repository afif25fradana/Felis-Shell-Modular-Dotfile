# Architecture Overview

Felis Shell is built with a modular and extensible architecture, designed to provide a powerful yet easy-to-manage command-line experience. This document details the high-level system design, data flow, and the organization of its core components.

## üéØ Design Principles

*   **Modularity:** Configurations are split into logical, self-contained files, making customization and maintenance straightforward.
*   **Extensibility:** A robust hook system allows for easy integration of new features and custom scripts.
*   **Performance:** Optimized components, such as Git status caching, ensure a responsive shell experience.
*   **Compatibility:** Designed for broad compatibility across Linux distributions, with graceful fallbacks for dependencies.
*   **Readability:** Clear, well-commented code and a logical file structure enhance understanding and contribution.

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level System Design

The Felis Shell environment is loaded in a specific, predictable order to ensure all components are initialized correctly and can interact seamlessly. The main entry point is `~/.bashrc`, which then sources all configuration files from the `~/.dotfiles/.bashrc.d` directory.

```

## üìÅ Component Breakdown

### 1. `~/.bashrc` (Main Entry Point)
This file is the primary configuration file for the Bash shell. It's responsible for:
*   Setting basic shell options.
*   Sourcing the `install.sh` script if it exists (for initial setup).
*   Sourcing all modular configuration files from `~/.dotfiles/.bashrc.d/`.

### 2. `00-colors.sh` (Colors & Styling)
*   **Purpose:** Defines the color palette and provides helper functions for printing colored messages to the terminal.
*   **Details:** Uses the Sweet Theme palette with 256-color support and fallbacks for broader compatibility. Includes semantic colors (e.g., `C_SUCCESS`, `C_ERROR`) and helper functions like `print_success`, `print_error`.

### 3. `01-aliases.sh` (Aliases & Environment)
*   **Purpose:** Contains a comprehensive collection of aliases for frequently used commands and sets essential environment variables.
*   **Details:** Includes aliases for navigation (`..`, `ll`), enhanced CLI tools (`ls` with `eza`, `cat` with `bat`), package management, development tools (Python, Node.js, Docker, Git), and system utilities. Features graceful fallbacks if enhanced tools are not installed.

### 4. `02-prompt.sh` (Intelligent Prompt)
*   **Purpose:** Configures the dynamic, multi-line shell prompt to provide rich, at-a-glance information.
*   **Details:** Displays user@host, current working directory, Git status (with caching for performance), active Python virtual environment, Node.js version, SSH session indicator, background job count, and the exit code of the last command.

### 5. `03-hooks.sh` (Hooks & Integrations)
*   **Purpose:** Implements a powerful shell hook system for automatic environment management and tool integrations.
*   **Details:** Manages auto-activation of Python virtual environments (venv, Poetry, Pipenv, Conda) and Node.js version switching via `.nvmrc`. Integrates with tools like FZF and Zoxide. Provides a generic API (`bashrc_add_hook`, `bashrc_run_hooks`) for registering and executing functions on specific events.

### 6. `functions/` (Custom Shell Functions)
*   **Purpose:** A directory containing a rich library of custom shell functions, organized by category, to automate common tasks and streamline workflows.
*   **Details:**
    *   `development.sh`: Functions for project initialization (`pyinit`, `nodeinit`, `newproject`).
    *   `directory.sh`: Functions for directory operations (`mkcd`, `backup`).
    *   `dotfiles.sh`: Functions for managing dotfiles (`dotfiles`).
    *   `fileops.sh`: Functions for file operations (`extract`).
    *   `help.sh`: The interactive help system (`help`).
    *   `n8n.sh`: Functions for n8n and ngrok workflow (`n8n-start`, `n8n-ngrok`).
    *   `network.sh`: Functions for network operations (`myip`, `portcheck`).
    *   `project.sh`: Functions for project management.
    *   `system.sh`: Functions for system maintenance (`sysclean`, `serv`).
