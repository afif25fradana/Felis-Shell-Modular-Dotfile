Welcome to **Felis Shell**, my personal collection of dotfiles for creating a comfy and powerful command-line setup. I originally built this for Arch Linux, but it should work just fine on other distros like Ubuntu and Debian.

## ü§î Why I Made This

Honestly, I'm lazy. I got tired of forgetting command-line shortcuts and complex commands for different tools. Felis Shell is my attempt to automate all that stuff away so I can have an easier and more enjoyable time in the terminal. If you're also tired of memorizing everything, maybe you'll find it useful too!

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Clone and Install:**
    ```bash
    # Clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/afif25fradana/Felis-Shell-Modular-Dotfile.git /tmp/felis-shell
    # Go into the new folder
    cd /tmp/felis-shell
    # Run the installer
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```
    
    You can also see what the installer will do without actually changing anything:
    ```bash
    ./install.sh --dry-run
    ```

2.  **Set Up Your Git Info:**
    Update the `.gitconfig` file with your name and email.
    ```bash
    # The dotfiles are installed to ~/.dotfiles, but you should edit the files in your cloned repository
    cd /tmp/felis-shell # Or wherever you cloned the repository
    # Open the .gitconfig file and add your info
    nano .gitconfig
    ```
    Here is a minimal example of what to add:
    ```ini
    [user]
      name = Your Name
      email = you@example.com
    ```

3.  **Reload Your Shell:**
    Open a new terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` to see the changes.
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

## üß™ Testing & Debugging

Felis Shell includes comprehensive testing and debugging tools to ensure your dotfiles work correctly:

### Test Script
The `test_dotfiles.sh` script provides automated testing for your configuration:
```bash
# Run all tests
./test_dotfiles.sh

# Run with debug mode (pauses between tests)
./test_dotfiles.sh -d

# Run a specific test
./test_dotfiles.sh --run-test syntax

# Get help
./test_dotfiles.sh --help
```

### Debug Script
The `debug_dotfiles.sh` script helps troubleshoot issues:
```bash
# Run debug session
./debug_dotfiles.sh

# Run debug session with verbose output
./debug_dotfiles.sh -v
```

For detailed information about these tools, see the **[Testing & Debugging Guide](docs/testing-debugging.md)**.

## ‚ú® Features

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚ùØ
    ```
-   **Modern Commands:** Aliases that use modern tools like `eza` for `ls` and `bat` for `cat`, with fallbacks if they're not installed.
-   **Handy Functions:** A bunch of useful functions like `mkcd` (to make a directory and enter it) and `extract` (to decompress any archive).
-   **Automatic Environment:** Automatically activates Python virtual environments and switches Node.js versions when you `cd` into a project.
-   **Safe Installation:** The `install.sh` script backs up your old dotfiles before it does anything.
-   **Nerd Fonts:** Uses Nerd Font icons to make things look nice.
-   **Lots of Dev Tools:** Plenty of aliases and functions for Git, Docker, Python, and Node.js.
-   **Testing & Debugging:** Comprehensive tools to validate and troubleshoot your configuration.

## üèóÔ∏è How It's Put Together

Everything is loaded in a specific order to make sure it all works correctly.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[~/.bashrc] --> B{Load files from ~/.dotfiles/.bashrc.d/*};
    B --> C[00-colors.sh];
    B --> D[01-aliases.sh];
    B --> E[02-prompt.sh];
    B --> F[03-hooks.sh];
    B --> G[user.conf.example];
    B --> H[functions/*.sh];
```

1.  `~/.bashrc`: The main file that starts everything.
2.  `00-colors.sh`: Sets up the terminal colors.
3.  `01-aliases.sh`: Defines all the command shortcuts.
4.  `02-prompt.sh`: Configures the shell prompt.
5.  `03-hooks.sh`: Manages the "smart" features.
6.  `user.conf.example`: An example file for your own custom settings.
7.  `functions/*.sh`: Loads all the custom shell functions.

## üîí A Note on Security

*   **`sudo`:** Commands that need `sudo` will ask for your password, so you always know when elevated privileges are being used.
*   **Installation:** The `install.sh` script uses your system's package manager to install tools safely.
*   **`shellcheck`:** All the scripts are checked with `shellcheck` to avoid common scripting errors.

## ‚ö° Performance

*   **Git Status Caching:** The prompt caches the Git status for a few seconds to keep things fast, even in big repos.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Functions and aliases are loaded efficiently.
